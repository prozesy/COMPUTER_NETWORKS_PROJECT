## Network Simulation Technologies Used: 
The following networking technologies are utilized in this project:
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):** Enables automatic IP address assignment to devices on the network.
- **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF):** An interior gateway protocol used for efficient routing within the network.
- **Routing Information Protocol (RIP):** A distance-vector protocol for dynamic routing.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT):** Translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses for internet connectivity.
- **Static and Dynamic Routing:** Combination of predefined routes and dynamically updated routes for effective data transmission.
- **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP):** An advanced distance-vector routing protocol for improved network performance.
